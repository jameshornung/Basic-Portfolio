			<p class="bio-content">Hailing from a small town in nestled in the piney woods of East Texas, James came to Austin to attend the University of Texas, where he majored in Journalism. His love of Austin has kept him there.  He has bartended on Sixth Street, lifeguarded at Barton Springs Pool, and slung burgers at Waterloo Ice House.  James worked as a math tutor in Southeast Austin, conducting initiatives to enhance studentâ€™s understanding of the math curriculum.  After working for an Austin medical billing start up, James has worked as a billing specialist for public and private ambulance companies for the last seven years.</p>

			<p class="bio-content">When not at his computer, James enjoys training for marathons, participating in the Austin Runners Club, practicing yoga, watching Longhorn sports, and enjoying all the things Austin has to offer.</p>
